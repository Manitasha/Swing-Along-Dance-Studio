<div id="faq">
<h4>Do you travel to locations to teach?</h4>
<p>Yes, i travel to locations within 30 miles of Redmond. Classes that require me to travel will cost $ 20 more than the regular classes.</p>

<h4> Do you take private lessons? how do i decide whether to take group lessons or private lesson?</h4>
<p>Yes, i do offer private lessons.However, i suggest that you start out in a group class as it will be a class of peers where everyone will be at relatively the same level and you will learn the basics together.It will also give you the opportunity to dance with multiple partners and experiment with your range and style and meet new people who share the same interest</p>


<p>A private lesson is a one on one learning and will be tailored according to your specific needs.
</p>

<h4>What is the general age group for the group lessons?</h4>
<p>The average age group for a group is between 16-60 years old. All ages enjoy dancing together but rest assured you will find and meet people your age.</p>

<h4>How many people are there in a group?</h4>
<p>There are a maximum of 8 people in a group.All the people in a group are at the same level so the classes take place at the same pace and style that suits everyone.</p>

<h4>Do you train for professional competitions?</h4>
<p> yes, i do train for professional competitions.Many of my students have performed successfully at professional levels. You can read their testimonials and can schedule a consult with me to ascertain your goals and levels of training.
</p>

<h4>Do i need to get a partner to learn?</h4>
<p>No, you don’t need a partner to take dance lessons.Majority of the people in the class are singles and people change partners throughout the class.</p>

<h4>What do I wear?</h4>
<p>A- wear comfortable clothes. Most girls wear light weight summer skirts or dresses and men wear short sleeved shirts and cotton trousers. Don’t wear long necklaces and scarfs as they can get in the way of dance. Shoes for both men and woman should slide on the floor and stay on your feet.Hard soles (leather) are the best for all of our locations!</p>

<h4>What is the difference between a dance lesson and a dance social?</h4>
<p>A- A dance lesson is conducted by a teacher and it works on watch and follow method. The teacher will show you the moves and the student follows.If and when required the teacher will correct the student.It is a method of learning a new skill whereas a dance social is a fun environment where the dancers work on their dance routines  and there is more social interaction.A dance social is aimed at meeting new people and to practice your skill.</p>

<h4>What CD/music is good to practice to?</h4>
<p>When you first start learning how to dance, it is good to practice to slower music with a clear beat. Once you become comfortable, start to challenge yourself by dancing to faster music and more subtle beats.You can always ask me for a playlist for beginners and i will be happy to provide you that.
</p>

<h4>How long will it take me to learn to dance?</h4>
<p>The more you practice, the more you will learn!. It usually takes a few months to feel truly comfortable and confident on the dance floor. We encourage you to practice as much as possible. After the classes you can attend the socials in order to practice in a supportive environment.</p>

<h4>what days/hours are you available?</h4>
<p>I am available all 5 days of a week for classes however it will be best to check my calendar and to schedule a class before arriving at the location.
